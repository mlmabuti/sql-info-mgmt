/**
SQL SCRIPT 1: List the transaction number, sales date, product code, 
description, unit and quantity from hope database.  Sort according to 
transaction number and product code. Use LEFT JOIN in your solution.

SQL SCRIPT 2: Display the employee number, last name, first name, job description,
and effectivity date from the job history of the employee. Sort last name and 
effectivity date (last date first). Use LEFT JOIN.

SQL SCRIPT 3: Show total quantity sold from product table.  Display product code, 
description, unit, quantity. Use RIGHT JOIN.  Sort according to the most product sold.

SQL SCRIPT 4:  Generate the detailed payments made by customers for specific 
transactions.  Display customer number, customer name, payment date, official
receipt no, transaction number and payment amount. Sort according  to the 
customer name. Use LEFT JOIN.

SQL SCRIPT 5:  What is the current price of  each product?  Display product code, 
product description, unit, and its current price. Always assume that NOT ALL 
products HAVE unit price BUT you need to display it even if it has no unit 
price on it. DO NOT USE INNER JOIN.

HINT:  You will use MAX(). This is a nested join. Your list should consist only of 57 rows.
